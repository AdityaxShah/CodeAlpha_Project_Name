# CodeAlpha_Project_Name
This project is a simple yet efficient implementation of a Fibonacci series generator using Python. It utilizes Python's generator functions for memory-efficient computation and includes clean console output formatting.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Generates Fibonacci numbers up to a user-specified number of terms.

Uses yield for efficient memory usage.

Clean, comma-separated output without a trailing comma.

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

ðŸ§  How It Works
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
The generator function fibonacci_generator(x) yields one number at a time without storing the entire sequence in memory, making it suitable for large values of limit.
